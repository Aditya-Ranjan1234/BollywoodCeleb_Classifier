## Introduction

The Bollywood Celebrity Classifier is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the VGG16 architecture. It takes an image as input and predicts the Bollywood celebrity that the image resembles the most.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Upload an image to the web app.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extract features from the uploaded image using VGG16.
- **Similarity Measurement**: Measure the cosine similarity between the uploaded image and a set of precomputed celebrity images.
- **Prediction**: Display the most similar celebrity image and name.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of images of various Bollywood celebrities. The images are used to extract features and build a similarity-based classifier. \

## Model

The project uses the VGG16 model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. The top layers of the VGG16 model are removed, and the remaining layers are used to extract features from the images.

## Feature Extraction

The `feature_extractor` function extracts features from an image using the VGG16 model. The features are flattened and used to compute similarity with precomputed features of celebrity images.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Aditya-Ranjan1234/BollywoodCeleb_Classifier.git
    cd BollywoodCeleb_Classifier
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**
    - On Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4. **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Download the pre-trained VGG16 model weights:**
    The weights are automatically downloaded when running the app for the first time.

## Usage

1. **Run the Streamlit app:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. **Upload an image:**
    - Go to the web browser where the Streamlit app is running.
    - Upload an image of a face.

3. **View the results:**
    - The app will display the uploaded image and the most similar Bollywood celebrity image along with the predicted name.
